          <p>Are you using a public cafe to connect to the internet or just to review some important document?, then never take your eyes off of your electronics and never ask a stranger 
              to watch for your belongings, protect your screen from others and do not let others to watch over your shoulders and avoid out loud phone calls about sensitive information.</p>

          <p>Another very common cyber attack happens when an attacker lets USB flash drives in parking lots, some people are tempted to pick them up and review their content, attackers know, 
              so that is the most effective way to infect a corporate system, most of them are just waiting for somebody that invites them inside just inserting on a computer connected to the corporate network, those recently found USBs </p>

          <p>What are you doing with your physical mail? Do you know that it contains sensitive information about you?, try to switch to paperless statements and, in any case, dispose correctly those paper based mails from your bank, your 
              insurance company, your utility service company or any other companies that could have any sensitive information about you.
          </p>

          <p>Are you searching on the internet for that company that provides certain services that you require?, then suddenly it seems like you just found exactly what you are looking for, and then, boom!, the website is asking
              for your name, email and phone number so they can send you the information, well, think twice. Do you really need to share that sensitive information to them, remember, most of the user names in sensitive websites like Banks are
              simply your Email, so you are giving away half of the login information to god knows who!!
              .</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Free WiFi</h2>

          <p>Be careful with where you are connecting, free WiFi is not secure at all, avoid them, if you need them ask the restaurant or cafe staff for the credential authentication and avoid logging into any personal web site, such as banks 
              or insurance companies, do not connect to any free wifi network that you do not recognize.
          </p>

          <p>When you connect to free WiFi, it is generally Unencrypted, that means anyone can see what you are up to over the network.  One way a Hacker can attack is by placing an access point between you and the public connection
              then, you will be sent information through the hacker and he can see everything, credit cards, bank accounts login, email login, social media accounts login information, a hacker can even download malware to your computer and access
              offline documents on your computer, they can take control of your camera and microphone, so people can eavesdrop on what you are doing in the real world, not just online.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">There is no technology today that cannot be defeated by social engineering, which means using deception, manipulation and influence to convince a human who has access to a computer system
              to do something, like click on an attachment in an e-mail.</blockquote>

          <p>If you still need to use free WiFi, then is better o get a good VPN (virtual provate network) to route all your data through another server to help increase security and privacy, your info is still at risk, but, it is most 
              difficult to access it because it has to be decrypted, and, most hackers, are looking for easy targets.</p>
